Notes on Philornis/Geospiza papers

Koop et al. 2015 | An introduced parasitic fly may lead to local extinction of Darwin’s finch populations

    Work through the full math of their model later

    Main takeaway: Philornis will cause extinction of geospiza fortis without either intervention or evolutionary response

Lamichhaney et al. 2015 | Evolution of Darwin’s finches and their beaks revealed by genome sequencing

    10X coverage, short read (2x100 bp), aligned to G. fortis.

    We identified Z- and W-linked scaffolds on the basis of significant differences in read depth between males (ZZ) and females (ZW) (Supplementary Table 1) -- try this with Cardinalis

    effective population sizes of Darwin’s finch species within a range of 6,000–60,000 (Supplementary Text)

    particularly among ground and tree finches, with almost no fixed differences between species in each group

    The FST distribution was Z-transformed (ZFST) and regions with striking ZFST values were identified (Fig. 3a). -- why? try this with Cardinalis, maybe?

    Natural selection on beak size and shape of G. fortis on Daphne Major Island has led to evolutionary change in the past few decades5,30. Moreover, genetic variation in beak shape has been increased through introgressive hybridization5,30 with two species of Geospiza, scandens and fuliginosa, that have relatively pointed beaks. Therefore we expect hybrids and backcrosses in the G. fortis population to have a relatively high frequency of the P haplotype. We genotyped an additional 25 G. fortis at ALX1, added them to the sample of 62 (Methods) and com- pared the haplotype frequencies in eight hybrids (including backcrosses) and 79 non-hybrids. ALX1-P had a frequency of 0.75 among hybrids, and 0.44 among the others, which is statistically significant in the ex- pected direction (P 5 0.03, Fisher’s exact test). Thus, ALX1-P alleles introduced by introgressive hybridization most probably contributed to evolution of more pointed beaks in 1987 following natural selection as a result of a change in food supply in the 1985–86 drought30.
        Keep in mind other changes that may have affected genomewide patterns of selection in the past 30ish years. Honestly hard to say why a drought within the short observed history of this species would be showing up in the genome -- was this drought unsual?

Lamichhaney et al. 2016 | A beak size locus in Darwin’s finches facilitated character displacement during a drought

    This seems like a journal I could aim for with my Ch4

    They looked at genome wide variation for association with beak morphology and identified one region containing the HMGA2 gene, which they believe to be relevant to beak growth based on the fact that it can affect facial growth in humans. They genotyped medium ground finch individuals on Daphne Major (34 dead and 37 alive) after a drought and found differential survival rates for genotypes at this loci.



McNew and Clayton 2016 | Alien Invasion: Biology of Philornis Flies Highlighting Philornis downsi, an Introduced Parasite of Gala ́pagos Birds

    Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae)

    coprophages -- feed on feces
    hematophagous -- feed on blood
    most sp. have subcutaneous larvae, but p. downsi and p. falsifica larvae externally attach
    P. downsi -- first instar in nares or developing quills, second and third in nest material
    In vitro, 3 days for eggs to hatch, 9-10 in larval stages (how long in first instar?), 9-10 as pupae
    But in field, the larvae may develop in as few as 4 days
    17-23 days total

    General trend of positive relationship between host body size and number of P. downsi; HOWEVER in small, medium, and large ground finches, medium have the highest number of P. downsi -- maybe something about them reduces resistance

    Larvae first found in galapagos in 1998
    Adults collected in the 1960s

    Population size associated with rainfall, not associated with urbanization

    Within a single brood, intensity of infection is highest in first nestling, but mortality is higher in younger nestlings (likely because of reduced tolerance of younger smaller nestlings)

    Parasitized nestlings have lower hemoglobin

    Prevalence is really high in Galapagos -- >80%. More severe effects and prevalence than other Philornis species. Virulence is greater in other instances of a new host-parasite relationship (introduced in Puerto Rico, European starlings in Argentina)

    Host defenses: 
    Avoidance (change breeding time, nesting site)
    Immune response (nesting female medium ground finches, ineffective though -- 100% of infected died)
    Behavioral resistance: preening (rare in darwin's finches)
        Female finches actually stand more when nests are parasitized to avoid being fed upon, putting nestlings more at risk
        Some evidence of self-medicating: seen rubbing Galapagos guava or guayabillo tree (Psidium galapegium) Cimadom et al.
        Increased provisioning of nestlings (mockingbirds but not medium ground finch)
        Clutch size is small in native hosts (Darwin's finches have large clutches and this may influence evolution of clutch size over time)

        hybridization between small and medium tree finches on Floreana Island, with fewer P. downsi in the nests of hybrids 

    Native hosts to P. downsi have similar infection rates to Galapagos hosts. The difference seems to be in the tolerance.

My study
    Three species: small tree finch, medium ground finch, vegetarian finch.
    
    Small tree finch: 11 cm; 11–16 g. Nest built by male, a sphere with entrance at side towards top, made from dry grasses and other vegetation (often moss and lichen used in construction). Clutch usually 4 eggs, whitish with pinkish or brown spots. No other information. Cimadom et al. (19) hypothesized that low reproductive success in small tree finches and warbler finches (Certhida olivacea) on Santa Cruz Island was the result of several interacting factors, including P. downsi, heavy rainfall, and habitat change. In a comparison of small, medium, and large tree finches (Camarhynchus parvulus, C. pauper, and C. psittacula), O’Connor et al. (100) found that intensity was highest in nests of the medium-sized tree finch (C. pauper).
    
    Medium ground finch: 11–12 cm; 18–32 g. Nest built by male, a sphere with entrance towards top and on side, made from dry grasses and other vegetation. Clutch usually 4 eggs, whitish with pinkish or brown spots. Incubation c. 12 days; fledging 10–14 days. A recent population viability model suggests that P. downsi has the potential to cause local extinction of medium ground finch populations on Santa Cruz Island within 100 years. Paradoxically, populations of the medium ground finch appear to be stable or even increasing, despite the effect of P. downsi on reproductive success. A prolific finch can hatch 45 nestlings over the course of her lifetime (51)! As a result, species such as the medium ground finch may be able to maintain reproductive rates greater than 1, even if fledging success in any particular clutch is low. Nesting female medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) mount an immune response when para- sitized (76). Koop et al. (75) found that neither prevalence nor intensity of P. downsi in medium ground finch nests was diminished in an exceptionally dry year on Santa Cruz Island. 

    Vegetarian finch: 16 cm; 29–40 g. Generally not negatively affected by Philornis, despite experiencing infections (McNew and Clayton). One of the two largest hosts, alongside Galapagos mockingbird. Breeds primarily in wet season. Nest domed, with side entrance, made from grass. No other information. Heimpel et al. (55) suggest that a short, intense rainy season increased food available to breeding vegetarian finches, which may have helped to mitigate potential negative effects of P. downsi on nestlings.
